        Meeting new people who has the same interest as yourself can be a challenging
        thing to do especially when you donâ€™t know where to start.
        Our application targets users that are interested in meeting new
        people through an activity that they both enjoy and hopefully form a lifelong friendship amongst the users.

        There are a few pre-existing applications for meeting random people to connect with.
        These apps allow to users make new friends and start a conversation with them. However, our application
        is different from them as it matches people according to a common goal instead of an interest and is more user friendly.
